What do I do to ignore what's behind me? Do I follow my fate and escape blindly? Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?  Do I let it go and try to stand it? Or do I try to catch them red-handed? Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness? Or do I trust none and live life in lonliness?  The sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men I make the right turns but I'm lost within I put on my daily fa\u00e7ade but then I just end up getting hurt again by myself   (myself) I ask why (but in my mind I find) I can't rely on myself (myself) I ask why (but in my mind I find) I can't rely on myself   I can't hold on (to what I want when I'm stretched so thin) It's all too much to take in I can't hold on (when I'm against you I can't win) With thoughts of failure sinking in   If I turn my back I'm defenseless And to give in to fate seems senseless If I hide my pride I lie sleepless And won't be able to cope with my weakness  If I let them go I'll be outdone But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself   (myself) I ask why (but in my mind I find) I can't rely on myself (myself) I ask why (but in my mind I find) I can't rely on myself   I can't hold on (to what I want when I'm stretched so thin) It's all too much to take in I can't hold on (when I'm against you I can't win) With thoughts of failure sinking in   How do you think that I've lost so much Always afraid and I'm out of touch? How do you expect that I will know what to do When all I know is what you tell me to?   Don't you (know) I can't tell you how to make it (go) No matter what I do, how hard I (try) I can't seem to convince myself (why) I'm stuck on the outside    I can't hold on (to what I want when I'm stretched so thin) It's all too much to take in I can't hold on (when I'm against you I can't win) With thoughts of failure sinking in  I can't hold on (to what I want when I'm stretched so thin) It's all too much to take in I can't hold on (when I'm against me I can't win) With thoughts of failure from within "]}
