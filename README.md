### ◘ Requirements
* selenium~=4.8.3
* pandas~=2.0.0
* openpyxl~=3.1.2
* matplotlib~=3.7.1
* seaborn~=0.12.2
* setuptools~=65.5.1

</br></br>


### ◘ Module Installation (setup.py)
1. To use the *setup.py* file in Python, the first objective is to have the *setuptools* module installed. It can be accomplished by running the following command:
```
pip install setuptools                                     
```
2. Once the setuptools module is installed, use the setup.py file to build and distribute the Python package by running the following command:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
3. In order to install all the requirements, run the following command:
```
pip install .                                 
```

### ◘ Python Library Installation (using pip)
In order to *install* the required packages on the local machine, Open pip and run the following commands separately:
```
> pip install selenium                    

> pip install pandas                                                                                           

> pip install seaborn

> pip install matplotlib                            
```
